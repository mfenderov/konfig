## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow Go conventions and best practices
- Use `gofmt` to format your code
- Add comments for exported functions and types
- Keep functions focused and small

### Testing
- **All new code must include tests**
- Aim for high test coverage (>90%)
- Test both success and error cases
- Include integration tests for new features

### Documentation
- Update README.md for new features or API changes
- Add examples for new functionality
- Update struct tag documentation for new tags
- Keep documentation concise and practical

### Commit Messages
Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
```
feat: add support for custom configuration directories
fix: handle empty environment variable defaults correctly
docs: update struct tag examples in README
test: add integration tests for profile loading
```

## üéØ Areas for Contribution

### High Priority
- **Performance optimizations** - faster configuration loading
- **Additional struct tag features** - validation, transformation
- **Better error messages** - more helpful error reporting
- **Configuration validation** - built-in validation helpers

### Medium Priority
- **Additional file formats** - JSON, TOML support
- **Configuration watching** - reload on file changes
- **Environment-specific optimizations** - production vs development
- **Documentation improvements** - more examples, tutorials

### Low Priority
- **CLI tools** - configuration validation utilities
- **IDE integrations** - better development experience
- **Additional profile features** - profile inheritance, merging

## üêõ Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:

1. **Go version** and operating system
2. **konfig version** or commit hash
3. **Minimal reproduction case** - ideally a failing test
4. **Expected vs actual behavior**
5. **Configuration files** (if relevant)
6. **Error messages** or logs

### Bug Report Template
```markdown
## Bug Description
[Clear description of the bug]

## Reproduction Steps
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

## Expected Behavior
[What should happen]

## Actual Behavior
[What actually happens]

## Environment
- Go version: [e.g., 1.24]
- OS: [e.g., macOS 14.0]
- konfig version: [e.g., v0.17.0]

## Additional Context
[Any other relevant information]
```

## ‚ú® Feature Requests

For feature requests, please:

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Describe the use case** - why is this needed?
3. **Propose an API** - how should it work?
4. **Consider backwards compatibility** - will this break existing code?
5. **Offer to implement** - are you willing to contribute the code?

### Feature Request Template
```markdown
## Feature Description
[Clear description of the desired feature]

## Use Case
[Why is this feature needed? What problem does it solve?]

## Proposed API
[How should the feature work? Include code examples]

## Backwards Compatibility
[Will this change break existing code?]

## Implementation Notes
[Any technical considerations or constraints]
```

## üîç Code Review Process

### For Contributors
- **Keep PRs focused** - one feature or fix per PR
- **Write good PR descriptions** - explain what and why
- **Be responsive** to review feedback
- **Update documentation** as needed
- **Ensure CI passes** before requesting review

### Review Criteria
- **Functionality** - does it work as intended?
- **Testing** - is it well tested?
- **Performance** - no significant regressions
- **API design** - is it consistent and intuitive?
- **Documentation** - is it properly documented?
- **Backwards compatibility** - does it break existing code?

## üìö Project Philosophy

konfig follows a **"merciless simplification"** approach:

- **Keep what provides value, eliminate what doesn't**
- **Every feature must solve a real user problem**
- **Performance and simplicity over complex abstractions**
- **Clear, focused APIs over extensive configuration options**
- **Practical examples over comprehensive documentation**

### Design Principles
1. **Simple by default** - common use cases should be easy
2. **Extensible when needed** - support advanced scenarios
3. **Fast and lightweight** - minimal performance overhead
4. **Type-safe** - leverage Go's type system for safety
5. **Predictable** - consistent behavior across features

## üéâ Recognition
